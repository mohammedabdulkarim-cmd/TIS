### My name is Abdulrahman Mohammed
I am a first-year college student currently pursuing a course in Network Security. I am interested in understanding how computer networks work and how to protect systems from security threats. I am building my technical skills through coursework, practical labs, and hands-on projects while continuously learning new technologies related to cybersecurity and networking.
